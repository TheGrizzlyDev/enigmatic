- Create a standard library with audio
- Create a POC UI
- Implement proper turnovers (?) maybe programmable (?)
- Create a reflector and make it invertable
- Bubble up symbol locations so we can show the code bound to a specific step of the plan
- Add an execution plan with the other returned values so we can display step by step
